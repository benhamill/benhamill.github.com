This will be my final post on this blog, but that's not as dramatic as it seems. I've been setting up a Wordpress install over at <a href="http://garbled.benhamill.com/">http://garbled.benhamill.com/</a> and moving all the posts over there. I'm still messing with CSS to make it look right, but that'll just be a little while. If you like, you can go ahead and subscribe to <a href="http://garbled.benhamill.com/feed/">the feed</a> over there. After this post, all new posts will go into Wordpress.

In a couple of months, I'll make it so that http://blog.benhamill.com/ points at the Wordpress install, too, which will probably break your feed if you're subscribed to this one. So, go ahead and change your feed or bookmark or whatever. The first new post on the new engine will be about the ruby gem I just released about 20 minutes ago.
