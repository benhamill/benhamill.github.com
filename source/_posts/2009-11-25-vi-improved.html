I recently started using vim on my Linux machines for development (actually gvim and I just haven't gotten around to installing it on my Windows partition). I'd tried to learn it some time ago with the understanding that it's awesome, but it didn't catch on. I know a lot of smart people who use it and it was always one of those things that I felt would be really valuable for me to learn, but--it was hard.

Well, now it's easy. @<a href="http://twitter.com/adambair">adambair</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos/">this blog post</a> by <a href="http://www.derekwyatt.org/">Derek Wyatt</a>. It's a collection of videos he made introducing you to the most basic commands in vim. Enough to get your feet under you so that further research on your own has something to stick to. They're awesome.

However, the reason they're awesome is not just that he takes you step by step through the most important stuff or that he's lighthearted and friendly-sounding. The awesome part is that he <em>shows</em> you why it is that vim is so raved about. If you try to learn vim thinking that it's like TextMate or NotePad or something, you won't get it. And until you get it, there's very little impetus to get over the learning hump (or through the dip, depending on which way you chart things in your head).

The key to understanding, for me, was realizing this: You should not be spending most of your time with vim in insert mode. You should not be typing and selecting in the sense that Word teaches. You should be doing finds and replaces and yanks. You should be operating on your code with macros. If you're writing new code, great. You'll be in insert mode for a while, but even then, you'll want to invoke something that'll set up your class structure with maybe some default methods in it or something. And as soon as you're done, you'll want to be jumping around by line number, moving to a specific character in a line, replacing a segment of a line with two keystrokes. Really, just the movement possibilities blew my mind. So, <a href="http://vimeo.com/6999927">go watch the introduction</a>.
