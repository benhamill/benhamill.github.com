I run <a title="Arch Linux" href="http://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> on a computer, if I have a choice. I recently installed it on the MacBook Air my employer bought me (which saga is another post entirely). One of the things that I like about Arch is that they don't do big releases every X-period of time; the package repository is updated on a rolling basis. So I can get the latest version of whatever much sooner than my Ubuntuan brethren.

That's awesome, but also has some costs. One of those costs is that gcc gets updated for me way sooner than it does for people releasing Ruby versions and sometimes there are weird things that older releases of the compiler were more forgiving about or interpreted differently or whatever. So in order to get our app at work that we haven't yet ported to Ruby 1.9.2 to run, I need to have REE installed. This is how I got it done. This is one of those blog posts that I hope gets indexed so that the next time I have to do this and I ask Google about it, it will show me my own blog post.
<h4>Ruby-build</h4>
I like <a title="rbenv on GitHub" href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv" target="_blank">rbenv</a>. A lot of people prefer <a title="RVM" href="http://beginrescueend.com/" target="_blank">rvm</a>. I don't want to get into pros and cons or whatever now, but because I use rbenv for managing multiple ruby versions, I use <a title="ruby-build on GitHub" href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build" target="_blank">ruby-build</a> to install multiple ruby versions. The way ruby-build works is by executing recipes, which are pretty simple. Here is the one I wrote to handle the install. It's just a variation on the stock REE install recipe from ruby-build.

[gist id=1732092 file=ree-1.8.7-2011.12-stdout_patch]

I won't get deep into the details, but let's start with the last 3 lines. Ruby-build executes each of these directives in turn. The first of the three sets up the compiler and the next two each take a series of arguments. The first two of those arguments are what it's installing and where to get it. Any after that (you'll have to scroll right) are telling it what to do with it, once it's downloaded it. It will run the last arguments in the order given. So that brings us to the function I added at the top:Â <code>build_package_stdout_patch</code>.

When you pass those ending arguments into <code>install package</code>, it will look to execute a function by the name you gave it prepended with <code>build_package_</code>. So the function I wrote downloads a patch for a bug having to do with <a title="Ruby 1.8 - Bug #5108: ruby 1.8.7 fails to build with glibc 2.14 - Ruby Issue Tracking System" href="http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5108" target="_blank">creating rogue references to STDOUT</a>, then issues the patch command to work it into the REE source. I don't know a lot about the patch command, so there's a good chance this could be done more nicely (see below). After that, it runs ruby-build's standard ree_installer task wich builds and installs the REE source.
<h4>Running It</h4>
When you're using ruby-build and rbenv together, you get a nice command called <code>rbenv install</code>. You can either pass it the name of a recipe that ruby-build already knows about or the path to a recipe on your hard drive somewhere. So, in the directory where I had saved my recipe, I ran:

[gist id=1732092 file=run_command]

Note: There's some kind of problem with tcmalloc and the newest gcc. Or something. I don't really understand, but since this is just for local development, I decided not to worry too much about performance and skip it. If you set the environment variable <code>CONFIGURE_OPTS</code>, ruby-build will pass those options along in it's build process. So off it goes to the races. Then, I get this output:


[gist id=1732092 file=output]

Pay particular attention to the last half of this. After the progress bar, patch gets confused. That's because the patch is really for Ruby 1.8.7 MRI, not REE. So it complains about not being able to find the file it wants since the projects have slightly different directory structures. You can see where I entered the correct path (basically, I just prepended the <code>source</code> directory). With that information, the patch applies cleanly, it builds REE without tcmalloc and now I have a ruby called <code>ree-1.8.7-0211.12-stdout_patch</code>. Hopefully that's helpful to someone besides me.
