Well, I finally got this thing working. Don't book mark it yet, I plan on
changing the URL over, but have to deal with registration transfer, etc. and
don't feel like mucking with that yet. Please, if you like, comment on the
aesthetics or if you notice anything doesn't work.

I've got the source code for this blog up on <a
  href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, which you can check out <a
  href="http://github.com/BenHamill/garbled/tree/master">if you like</a>. I'm
sure people will say that I've got some stuff in source control that I
shouldn't. If you post something like that in the comments, I'll at least have
a look at it and consider. Deploying's a pain if you leave important stuff out
of version control, no?
