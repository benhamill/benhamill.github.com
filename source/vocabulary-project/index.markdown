**TRIGGER WARNING:** Slurs against a wide variety of people.

Let's face it, using oppressive slurs is bullshit. But so many of us do it
because they're so commonly used in our culture we may not realize it's
oppressive. This is a crap excuse. The way they become less common is for us to
stop using them. That's how we can avoid teaching the next generation to use
exclusionary vocabulary.

Because I don't want to be the equivalent of that horrifying older person at a
family gathering who still casually drops the n-word or whatever, I've put
together a little project for myself. I'm going to put a list of words on this
page (see trigger warning above). I'm going to work my way through the list,
eliminating them from my vocabulary. I'm sure I'll add to the list over time.

Sometimes, I might replace one slur with another. If and when I do, I'm sorry.
I'm, you know, working on it. If you like, mention it to me [on Twitter (@benhamill)](http://twitter.com/benhamill)
and I'll put it on the list.

This thing isn't exhaustive, by any means. But it's a way for me to make sure
I'm always working on improving how I use language and maybe others will find it
useful to change the way *they* choose words, too. It also doesn't cover making
a joke out of someone, which you don't need a slur to do, but is still awful.

I'm basing the list on articles like [this list of ablist words by Lydia Brown](http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html)
as well as conversations and feedback I've gotten directly.
