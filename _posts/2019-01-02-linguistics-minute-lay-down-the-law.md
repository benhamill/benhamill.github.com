_This was originally published in my work Slack on 2016-10-04, but I've since
been convinced that more people than just those few who can even read it there
might be interested. I've edited it for clarity and correctness. I'm going to
migrate all my Linguistcs Minutes over to my blog and probably post future ones
here._

The modern word _lay_ comes from a Proto-Germanic word _\*lagjan_ (the asterisk
means it's a reconstruction), which meant something like, "to put in place". In
Old English it also had the connotation of putting something down hard ("by
striking") in the form of _lecgan_.

The modern word _law_ comes to us from Old English _lagu_ of the same meaning
as the modern word and was borrowed from Old Norse _\*lagu_ meaning
"something that was laid down or fixed" which came from the Proto-Germanic word
_\*lagam._

Both Proto-Germanic words come from a common Proto-Indo-Europoean root _\*legh-_
which meant "to lie down or lay". So when you say you're "laying down the law",
you're sort of saying you're laying down that which is laid down.
