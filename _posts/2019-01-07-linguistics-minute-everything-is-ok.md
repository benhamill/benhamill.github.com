_This was originally published in my work Slack on 2016-10-05, but I've since
been convinced that more people than just those few who can even read it there
might be interested. I've edited it for clarity and correctness. I'm going to
migrate all my Linguistcs Minutes over to my blog and probably post future ones
here._

In Boston and New York, around 1838 and 1839, there was this slang trend to take
common two-word phrases, intentionally misspell them at the initial letters of
each word and then use those new initial letters as abbreviations for the
phrase.

For instance, _K.G._ was used for "know go", _K.Y._ for "know yuse" and _N.C._
for "nuff ced". All of these slang phrases died out except one: _O.K._ for "oll
korrect".

Why this single example lives on and is so wide-spread isn't quite clear.
There's a theory that Martin Van Buren's 1840 election had something to do with
it. He was nicknamed _Old Kinderhook_ after his birthtown and there was a New
York City organization supporting his re-election called the _O.K. Club_. It got
some national-level attention, even though he lost.

In 1919, Woodrow Wilson spelled it "okeh" on the assumption that it was related
to the Choctaw _okeh_ meaning "it is so". The spelling "okay" showed up in 1929
and quickly became the more popular spelling (besides just "OK", which is
currently in the lead).

So the next time someone gets pedantic at you about how to spell this word, you
can refute them with a historical argument. Or, as always, refute them more
fundamentally that language pedantry is kind of sad and we should be
descriptivist, not proscriptivist and they should just take a seat. Oll korrect?
