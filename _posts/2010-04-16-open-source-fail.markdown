title: Open Source Fail
---
Currently, this blog runs on a great Rails-based blog engine called <a href="http://www.enkiblog.com/">Enki</a>. I initially installed it here because I liked the idea of hacking on the engine a bit or looking under the hood as a learning experience. And it was educational, at first, but more and more, I find that I don't really want to mess with it. I'd rather the blog Just Work.

I'm thinking I might look at installing Wordpress and running Garbled that way. I'm not sure how it'll go, exactly, and it feels a little dirty, being php and all. But, really, blog software isn't something I really have a big interest in. I suspect that the Wordpress code base might not be as awesome as I'd like, but, honestly, I won't have to look at it and it has a lot of neat features that I've gotten used to on the <a href="http://rockmost.wordpress.com/">other blog</a> that I write at.

However, the real driving factor is in the idea that Wordpress is so widely used and stable. Comments have been broken here for a while and I've been too busy, distracted and/or lazy to track down why. In fact, as I was writing this, @<a href="http://twitter.com/jcsalterego/">jcsaltergo</a> discovered that I was having some kind of Passenger issue. Then it vanished. I don't really relish tracking it down.

I'm hoping that I can make the URL for the feed stay the same, but in case I can't, consider this fair warning, that you might have to resubscribe when it breaks. Similarly, I'll have to see what the best way to port all the posts is. I'm suspecting the copy/paste will win for simplicity.
