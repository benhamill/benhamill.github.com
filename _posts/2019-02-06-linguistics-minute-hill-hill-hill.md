_This was originally published in my work Slack on 2018-12-19, but I've since
been convinced that more people than just those few who can even read it there
might be interested. I've edited it for clarity and correctness. I'm going to
migrate all my Linguistics Minutes over to my blog and probably post future ones
here._

This is a short one. This is a list of redundant hill names in England (or other
places with English-the-place names). I just stole it [from
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_redundant_place_names#Mountains_and_hills)
and culled the list to be more targeted.

* Barrhill, barr is an old Celtic word for a flat topped hill.

  compare Bredon and Breedon on the Hill (Hill Hill on the Hill –
