_This was originally published in my work Slack on 2016-10-18, but I've since
been convinced that more people than just those few who can even read it there
might be interested. I've edited it for clarity and correctness. I'm going to
migrate all my Linguistcs Minutes over to my blog and probably post future ones
here._

_This one also requires a little foreword for those who don't work with me.
Below, there are some initialisms that aren't defined. They aren't super
important to understanding the post, but if you're curious, "MMF" stands for
MapMyFitness, a product my part of Under Armour works on and "UACF" stands for
Under Armour Connected Fitness, which was the name of my part of Under Armour at
the time of this writing._

This one's a reader request (even I didn't know I took requests üòú):

When you were in school, you were probably taught that we "use _a_ in front of
words starting with a consonant and _an_ in front of words starting with a
vowel." Here's a thing about English teachers, though: They love to tell you
about rules you should be following, but that's not really how language works.
They're also charged with getting those rules to stick in the minds of
distracted, uninsterested 7-year-olds, so they simplify things greatly and
often.

Do you know what the vowels of the English language are? You might think they're
"a", "e", "i", "o", "u" (and sometimes "y"). This is the list we're often taught
as kids. Those, however, are letters. Vowels, on the other hand, are **sounds**.
English has way more than five vowel sounds and they show up in a lot of
different places. Similarly, consonants aren't letters, but sounds.

Before we look at some examples, let's talk about **why** we have two different
forms of this word. _A/an_ is what's called an "indefinite article" in Linguistics
jargon (_the_ is the "definite article"). It appears routinely in a lot of
different phonetic environments and is very closely tied, semantically, with the
word that follows (because word order is so important in English, it always
preceeds the nouns it applies to).

Because of this close association and commonality, it's important to be easy to
say (or, rather, it is said so often that it naturally changed to become easy,
since people are lazy). Saying two vowel sounds in a row is sort of hard. You
either end up mooshing them together into a diphthong, dropping one or adding
some kind of consonant. Depending on which sounds predeed or follow a
constonant, some are harder to say than others, but /n/ has the nice property of
being kind of in the middle of the mouth, voiced (so it plays well next to
vowels) and sonorant (you can say it for a long time, if you like). This makes
is a particularly alluring consonant to slip in there. It's basically lubricant
between vowel sounds.

Oll korrect. Examples, right? Just‚Ä¶ one more thing. Since I'm going to be
talking about sounds, I'm going to trot out the International Phonetic Alphabet
(the IPA). It's an alphabet invented by linguists to accurately describe the
sounds humans make when speaking instead of relying on the spelling native to
the language. You can [read more about the IPA on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), if
you like.

I'm not going to use it to the full extent that's possible, since it can get
pretty hairy, but in a mode that's meant to describe the general **idea** of a
sound, rather than the specific sound made by a speaker in a particular
utterance. The notation for this is to enclose the characters in slashes. For
instance, my first name might be transcribed as /b…õn/.

So. Take the word _umbrella_. Most English speakers pronounce this word
something like /umb…π…úl…ô/ and would probably construct "an umbrella". This is not
because the word is spelled starting with "u", but because the word **sounds**
starting with /u/.

However, the word in the title of this post, _urologist_, also starts with "u",
but most folks pronounce it something like /j…ô…π…ël…ôdÕ° í…ôst/ (we use a lot of /…ô/ in
English, almost exclusively in unstressed syllables). The /j/ is a consonant
sound that is mostly spelled "y" in English (e.g. _yes_ is /j…õs/), so even
though it's not spelled explicitly in this word and it **looks** like it starts
with a vowel, this word actually starts with a consonant.

This brings us to the specific words in question: _MMF_ and _UACF_. These words
are abbreviations, which means the spelling is often very divorced from the
pronunciation since you're meant to say the letter names, not make the letter
sounds (as opposed to acronyms, where you are meant to pronounce the sounds e.g.
_SCUBA_). So _MMF_ is /…õm …õm …õf/ and _UACF_ is /j ä …õj si …õf/. When you look at
the IPA notation for those words, you start to see that even though _MMF_ starts
with the letter "M", it starts with the vowel sound /…õ/ and while _UACF_ starts
with the letter "U", it starts with the consonant sound /j/.

So that's the deal: It's about sounds, not letters. And when you're speaking,
you probably hardly ever think about it.

Interesting side note, when we are focusing on _a_ and _an_ in speech, we often
pronounce them like /…õj/ and /√¶n/, but in normal speech, because they're not
words that contribute to the core meaning of a sentence, they usually get
minimized to /…ô/ and /…ôn/.
