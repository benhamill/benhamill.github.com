You read my blog, right? I mean&mdash;here you are reading it. I've been having an internal debate for a while about something, wondering what people who read my blog would think. Then I realized there's a wonderful way to find out: ask.

So far, Garbled has been mostly about programming stuff. I also do a fair amount of table-top <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS">role playing</a> and since I started blogging, some of my ideas on that topic have ended up sounding like they might be worth a blog post. But I don't really have a role playing blog. In considering whether to post about both topics on Garbled, I've got two conflicting things going on:

  * People say you should pick a topic and stick to it if you want to build readership. By this advice, I should talk only about programming here and find another place to post role playing thoughts.
  * My thinking about programming and about role playing happen in adjacent or overlapping regions of my mind, so, to me, they are somewhat complimentary. I sort of feel like seeing both those lines of thought paints a (more) complete picture of me as a person.

So what are your thoughts? Would a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">rare or uncommon</a> post about role playing in general or maybe GURPS in specific be alright? Considering that it would mostly probably be about plot construction and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster">GM</a> related activities. Or should I stick to programming and programming-adjacent topics? Let me know in the comments.
