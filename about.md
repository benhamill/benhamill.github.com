## The Author

Ben Hamill (he/him) is a programmer that was born (13 Feb, 1982) and now lives
in Austin, Texas. For a while, he lived in Dallas and doesnâ€™t recommend the idea
to anyone.

He intentionally cultivates a childlike sense of humor and wonder and thinks
play is a wildly undervalued thing in our society. He likes all sorts of games:
role playing, video, board and card. He enjoys novels and comic books, well
designed things and whimsy.

His Discordian holy name is His Holiness Hery Fnord Episkopos of the Society for
Creative Anarchisms, Destroyer of Tuples and _Really Strong_. The crest of the
Hamill family is azure, two bars ermine.


## The Blog

This blog used to be called "Garbled" in part as a reference to the author's
feelings about the state of his thoughts that would appear here and in part
because at the time, the author was really into the Ruby programming language
and it was in vogue to name things with "rb" in them and make those letters red.

The current title is the same as [an HTTP status
code](https://httpstatuses.com/203) which indicates that the content of the
response may have been modified between leaving the server and getting to the
client. Basically, it's saying, "Take this with a grain of salt." This is
somewhat of an evolution of the original idea of the author's about the content
of this blog. It's not garbled thoughts, but even the author considers these
ideas provisional, so use your own judgement.
